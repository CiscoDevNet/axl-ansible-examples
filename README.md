# axl-ansible-samples

## Overview

These samples demonstrates how to use Ansible playbooks to read/update CUCM configurations via the AXL SOAP API and CUCM CLI/SSH.  Also included is a sample custom Ansible module which can execute CUCM CLI commands and return the output.

The concepts and techniques shown can be extended to enable automated management of virtually any configuration setting on CUCM or other Voice Operating System (VOS) based appliances.

**Tested with:**

- Ubuntu 22.04
- Ansible 2.12.6
- Python 3.10.4
- CUCM 14

> **Note:** this project was development on Linux.  While core concepts and most code should port to Windows/Mac well, some differences in Ansible implentation/capabilities may require workarounds.

## Pre-requisites

* Python 3.8+

## Available samples

* `add_line_monolithic.yml` - Demonstrates adding a single line with the basic built-in Ansible `uri` module ( `<addLine>`).

* `axl_version` - Retrieves the node product and AXL versions (`<getCCMVersion>`).

* `axL_new_line.yml` - Add a new line (`<addLine>`).

* `axl_new_phone.yml` - Add a new phone (`<addLine>`).

* `axl_new_user.yml` - Add a new user (`<addUser>`).

* `axl_add_line_phone_user.yml` - Compose multiple sub-tasks to add a user/phone/line in one playbook.

* `axl_bulk_add_users.yml` - Bulk-add users with associated phones/lines, as retrieved from a `.csv` file.

* `cisco_vos_cli.py` - Custom Ansible module using Python/[Paramiko](https://www.paramiko.org/) to run arbitrary commands on a node and parse/return the output.

* `cli_show_version.yml` - Run a CLI command to get the active version and display/parse the output.

* `cli_addhoc_command.yml` Run a run-time-defined CLI command on the node and display the output.

* `cli_set_cli_session_timeout.yml` - Run a CLI command which requires user input responses.

* `paramiko_test.py` - Stand-alone version of the `cisco_vos_cli.py` module (easier to debug).

## Getting started

* Create/activate a Python virtual environment named `venv`:

  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
* Install needed dependency packages:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

* Rename `inventory.yml.example` to `inventory.yml`, and edit it to specify your host(s) address and AXL/CLI user credentials.

* To run a specific sample, use the following command, e.g.:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook axl_new_line.yml
  ```

  You will be prompted for needed values (e.g. directory number/partition) if not provided via `--extra-vars`:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook axl_new_line.yml --extra-vars "dn=1001 routePartition=''"
  ```
    
 ## Hints

* Run playbooks with extra verbosity for debugging:

  ```bash
  ansible-playbook axl_version.yml -vvv
  ```

* The AXL sub-tasks do a little checking to see if adding objects fails due to the object already existing - if so the sub-task is marked as '`changed: no`' (otherwise it is marked '`changed: yes`') - a small attempt to follow the Ansible [indempotency](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/glossary.html) pattern.  The CLI module/sub-tasks do not do any special checking and so all tasks are left as default ('`changed: no`') whether they actually change something or not.

* The AXL playbooks use `getCCMVersion` to determine the AXL version of each host at run-time, and and AXL sub-tasks modify the `SOAPAction` header and `xlmns:ns` namespace in the XML templates accordingly.  However, no attempt is made to modify the schema of the AXL request itself based on version.  As AXL request schemas are pretty mature/stable (especially for basic/common requests) this works fine for now, at least for the current set of samples.

## Todo

* It should be possible to create a custom module using [Zeep](https://docs.python-zeep.org/en/master/) which can build AXL XML dynamically based on the AXL WSDL, per version.  This would also probably make development of additional AXL sub-tasks easier too, by avoiding XML templating.
